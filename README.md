**One question: "Does it make the game better?"**

A fork for builders - whether you're crafting systems in C# or content in YAML.

### Why Redline Exists
- **Yes by default** - Good ideas with rough implementation get help, not rejection
- **Push limits** - Testing what upstream considers "too risky"
- **Merit only** - PRs judged only on the value they bring
- **Systems focus** - Building for emergent gameplay and novel player experiences

### Contributing
All PRs welcome. If you're improving the game, you belong here.
